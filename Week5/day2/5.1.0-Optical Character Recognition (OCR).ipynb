    "**Overview:**\n",
    "Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process of converting images of text into machine-encoded text. This is useful for extracting text from images, such as scanned documents, photos, or screenshots. In this session, we will learn how to use the Tesseract OCR engine to extract text from images.\n",

    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the basics of OCR\n",
    "- Learn how to use the Tesseract OCR engine\n",

    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "1. Introduction to OCR\n",
    "    - **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: is a technology that recognizes text within digital images. It is used to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data.\n",
    "    - **History and Evolution of OCR**: OCR technology has evolved over the years, from early systems that required manual intervention to modern systems that use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to recognize text accurately.\n",
    "    - **Importance of OCR in Computer Vision**: OCR plays a crucial role in various applications, such as document processing, text extraction, data entry automation, and image-to-text conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Applications of OCR in Computer Vision**:\n",
    "    - **Document Processing**: OCR is used to extract text from scanned documents, invoices, receipts, and forms.\n",
    "    - **Text Recognition**: OCR can recognize text in images, videos, and real-world scenes.\n",
    "    - **Data Entry Automation**: OCR automates the process of entering data from documents into digital systems.\n",
    "    - **Image-to-Text Conversion**: OCR converts images containing text into editable and searchable text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How OCR Works**:\n",
    "    - **Preprocessing**: The input image is preprocessed to enhance the text regions and remove noise using \n",
    "    - **Text Detection**: Text regions are detected using techniques like edge detection, contour detection, or deep learning models.\n",
    "    - **Text Recognition**: The detected text regions are recognized using OCR engines like Tesseract, Google Vision API, or AWS Rekognition.\n",
    "    - **Postprocessing**: The recognized text is postprocessed to correct errors and improve accuracy."
